## SUMMARY
Flexible and open-minded developer. I consider myself to be hard-working and reliable. I never back down from a challenge and I prefer taking on the hardest of tasks.
I’m interested in all web technologies and I always try to incorporate well-proven, well-working software paradigms and ideas into the qualitative software that I write on a daily basis. I aim to learn something new every day and better myself every day. Very driven to become one of the very best technical experts out there. Consulting is what I consider myself to be best at.
I have worked for a wide variety of clients, ranging from small startups to enterprise level software. I am well-versed in agile methodologies and I have practiced them for a very long time.
I have been part of teams, leader of teams as well as working remotely on projects by myself. I prefer team oriented set-ups as that lets me practice one of my passions - teaching technologies and the art of writing code to others who are interested and willing to learn.
